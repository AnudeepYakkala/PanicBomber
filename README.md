# PanicBomber
My first javaFx game made during the Hello World hackathon


PanicBomber is a simple JavaFx two player game where players are competing to see who can score the most points. One players uses "wasd" to move and the other player uses the arrow keys. When a player is holding the bomb, points are being added to his or her score every second. When two players are at the same location, the bomb is transferred from one player to another. There is also a hidden timer that is displayed when there are five seconds remaining. During these five seconds, the players compete to get rid of the bomb as the player who has the bomb after the clock hits 0 loses half of his or her points.
